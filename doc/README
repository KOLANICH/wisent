This directory contains the Wisent users' manual.

The manual is written using the Sphix documentation generator.
A pre-formatted version of the manual can be found in the html/
sub-directory.  If you want to re-generate the documentation or
to generate a pdf version, you will need spinx version 0.6 or
newer.

A copy of the manual can be found online at
