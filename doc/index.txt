Wisent Users' Manual
====================

When writing a computer program, implementing methods to read data
from input files with a complex structure can be surprisingly
difficult.  For example, if the input data comes from an untrusted
source, errors in the input file often need to be dealt with very
carefully.  If your program is written in Python and if the input data
is sufficiently structured (*i.e.*, if the format can be described by a
`context free grammar`_, Wisent [#wisent]_ can help you to implement
parts of the input processing of your program.

This manual documents both the Wisent program and the Python code
Wisent generates for your project.  The manual is structured as
follows:
