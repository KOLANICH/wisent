DOCUMENTATION:

   The generated parser returns a parse tree of the following form:
leafes are represented as tuples of the form

    (True, x, ...)

where 'x' is a terminal symbol and "..." stands for any data attached
to it (i.e. '(x, ...)' was part of the input data.  Inner nodes are
represented as tuples of the form

    (False, X, ...)

where the non-terminal 'X' is the head of the corresponding production
and "..." stands for the parse trees for each of the symbols from the
right hand side of the production.


TERMINOLOGY:

rule, production rule, grammar rule    --- r, rule
rule index    --- k, key
word, string, sequence
(terminal, nonterminal) symbol, token    --- X
symbols have "replacements", "expansions", "derivations"
input: (type,value), (symbol, value)
parser state as a set    --- I, U
item (rule with a dot)    --- item
parser state as a number    --- state
