- test the ! operator
- fix wisent to deal with "examples/crash.wi"
- check the computation of expected tokens in case of parse errors
- write a proper manual page
- Extend the format of grammar files to allow for arbitrary
  (i.e. non-string) symbols in the generated parser.  Or allow for an
  alternative, Python-based input format.
