- Fix the column width in parser transition tables in the presence of
  conflicts.
- Implement LALR(1) parsers or good table compression for LR(1) parsers.
- Extend the format of grammar files to allow for arbitrary
  (i.e. non-string) symbols in the generated parser.  Or allow for an
  alternative, Python-based input format.
